## What is machine learning
* A mixture of theoretical and practical tools
1. When Can Machines Learn? (illustrative + technical)
2. Why Can Machines Learn? (theoretical + illustrative)
3. How Can Machines Learn? (technical + practical)
4. How Can Machines Learn Better? (practical + theoretical)

## When Can Machines Learn?
### __Learning:acquiring skill with experience accumulated from observations__
> Observation->__learning__->skill
### __machine learning: acquiring skill with experience accumulated/computed from data__
> data->__ML__->skill
## What is skill?
* improve some performance measure (e.g. prediction accuracy)
