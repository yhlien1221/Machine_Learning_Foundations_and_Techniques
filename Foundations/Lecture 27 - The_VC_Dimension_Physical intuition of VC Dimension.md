## The VC Dimension

### Physical intuition VC Dimension
* W also called featrues (the degrees of freedom).
* Degrees of freedom can be adjusted arbitrarily
* VC Dimension represents the capibility of classification in data

<br><br/>
* For instances, linear classification, dvc = 3, W ={w_0,w_1,w_2}.
* Learning can be proceeded by 3 features (the degree of freedom is 3)
* M is proportional to dvc
