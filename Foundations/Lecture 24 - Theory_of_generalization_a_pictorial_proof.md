## Theory of generalization

### Restriction of Break point
#### Recap of break point
* Four growth functions for four types of break points are listed below

<br><br/>
* N: How many data piont?
* k=2:shatter any two points
* Maximum possible mh(N) when N=3 and k=2 is 4.

<br><br/>
#### Conclusion
* We can reduce the complexity of mh(N) by adding limitation to N with break point
* We can say mh(N) is polynomial if mh(N) with break point is equal to poly(N)

* break point at k=2 (N=2), the maximum combination at k=2 is 3.
* Any of two point cannot be shattered when N=3
