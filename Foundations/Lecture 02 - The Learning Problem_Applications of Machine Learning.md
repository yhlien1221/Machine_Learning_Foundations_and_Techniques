###Applicatoins of machine learning
## Applications of machine learning (ML is everywhere!)
1. Food
2. Clothing
3. Housing
4. transportation
5. Education
> studentsâ€™ records on quizzes on a Math tutoring system->ML->predict whether a student can give a correct answer to
another quiz question
6. Entertainment
> how many users have rated some movies->ML-> predict how a user would rate an unrated movie

* ML is a method to get the g and we hope the g is same or similar to target function (f)
