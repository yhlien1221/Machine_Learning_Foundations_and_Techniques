## Feasibility of learning

### Learning with Different Input Space X
- Concrete features
* ex: the size and weight of coins or characteristics of each patients.
- Raw features
* ex: image or article. Those data need to be converted into concrete features (Feature transform).
- Abstract features
* ex:coding number or ID.
