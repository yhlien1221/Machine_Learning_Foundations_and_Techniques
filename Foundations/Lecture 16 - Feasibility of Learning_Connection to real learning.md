## Feasibility of learning

### Connection to Real Learning
* Take coins for example, 150 students flip coin for 5 times, it found that at least one person 
<br>has the chance of 5 heads is over 99%. Can we say this coin has a representative? <br/>
<br>No, we can't, Normally the probability of head for each coin is 0.5.<br/>
* **BINGO** when get all green balls? No, we can't say that.
* When large N, may have bad sample which would have big difference between Ein and Eout.

* Multiple D can be generated by sampling.
* Hoeffding’s inequality can make sure that Ein is similar to Eout in most of D. In a few of D, bad sample did happpen.
* Dn in any of hypothesis is bad, then Dn is bad data. Dn is good data if Dn in any of hypothesis is good.

* The upper bound of bad dat can be expressed by union bound based on inequality
* M is the number of hypothesis, N is the number of D, epsilon is the parameter of tolerance
* Union bound indicates that the P(bad data) is low when M is finite and N is large (Ein similar to Eout)

* What if M is not finite? this will be discussed in next chapter.
