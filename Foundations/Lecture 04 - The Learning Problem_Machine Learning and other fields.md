# Machine learning and data mining
## Machine learning
* use data to compute hypothesis g that approximates target f
## Data mining
* Use (huge) data to find property that is interesting
## Connections between machine learning and data mining (difficult to distinguish ML and DM in reality)
1. if "interesting property" __same as__ "hypothesis that approximate
target"
> __ML = DM__ (usually what KDDCup does)
2. if "interesting property" related to "hypothesis that approximate
target"
> DM can help ML, and vice versa (often, but not always)
3. traditional DM also focuses on __efficient computation in large
database__
#  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
## Machine Learning
* use data to compute hypothesis g that approximates target f
## Artificial Intelligence
* compute __something that shows intelligent behavior__
## Connections between machine learning and AI (ML is one possible route to realize AI)
1. g ≈ f is something that shows intelligent behavior
> __ML can realize AI__, among other routes
2. e.g. chess playing
> traditional AI: game tree
> ML for AI: ‘learning from board data’
#  Machine Learning and Statistics
## Machine Learning
* use data to compute hypothesis g that approximates target f
## Statistics
* use data to __make inference about an unknown process__
## Connections between machine learning and Statistics (statistics: many useful tools for ML)
1. g is an inference outcome; f is something unknown
> statistics __can be used to achieve ML__
2. traditional statistics also focus on __provable results with math assumptions,__ and care less about computation
