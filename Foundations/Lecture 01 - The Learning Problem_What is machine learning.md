## What is machine learning
* A mixture of theoretical and practical tools
1. When Can Machines Learn? (illustrative + technical)
2. Why Can Machines Learn? (theoretical + illustrative)
3. How Can Machines Learn? (technical + practical)
4. How Can Machines Learn Better? (practical + theoretical)

## When Can Machines Learn?
### __Learning:acquiring skill with experience accumulated from observations__
> Observation->__learning__->skill
### __Machine learning: acquiring skill with experience accumulated/computed from data__
> data->__ML__->skill
## What is skill?
* improve some performance measure (e.g. prediction accuracy)
* __Machine learning__:improving some performance measure with experience computed from data
> data->__ML__->improved performance measure (ex: stock data->ML->more investment gain)
## ML: an alternative route to build complicated systems (ex: something that is difficult to be defined by human)
## Key essence of Machine learning (help decide whether to use ML)
1. Exists some "underlying pattern" to be learned (so "performance measure" can be improved)
2. but no programmable (easy) definition (so "ML" is needed)
3. somehow there is data about the pattern (so ML has some "input" to learn from)
