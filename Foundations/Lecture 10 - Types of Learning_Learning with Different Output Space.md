## Type of learning


### Learning with different data label yn
1. Supervised learning:classification in data with label (most common)
2. Unsupervised learning:Cluster in data without label
3. Semi-supervised learning: a portion of data with label and the remaining without label.

4. Reinforcement Learning: RL is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior in an environment to obtain maximum reward. This optimal behavior is learned through interactions with the environment and observations of how it responds, similar to children exploring the world around them and learning the actions that help them achieve a goal.
